			<p>
				One touch and you got me stoned<br />
				Higher than I've ever known<br />
				You call the shots and I follow<br />
				Sunrise but the night's still young<br />
				No words, but we speak in tongues<br />
				If you let me, I might say too much<br />
				Your touch blurred my vision It's your world, and I'm just in
				it<br />
				Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight<br />
				'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you<br />
				I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it<br />
				But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh<br />
				Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed<br />
				Too late, now you're in my blood<br />
				I don't hate the way you keep me up<br />
				Your touch blurred my vision It's your world, and I'm just in
				it<br />
				Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight<br />
				'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you<br />
				I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it<br />
				But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh<br />
				Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh,<br />
				ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br />
				'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you<br />
				I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it<br />
				But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh<br />
				By you, ooh-ooh-ooh
